These are the three programs which I felt gave the best spread of results from many different betting strategies my friends and I tried.
These programs allow the viewer to see how variations in betting strategy can make minor adjustments to the expected win rate and mean money earned without showing strategies that are extremely bad, thereby providing a useful comparison.
These programs do not need each other to work, all you have to do is run one of them and the final results will be output.
There is some code such as the time.sleep function which allows the user to see what is happening with enough time to process the output, but heavily reduces the speed at which the program runs.
This code can be removed without harming the program overall.
